      "As a UI Developer trainee at Naresh i Technologies, I design and develop user-friendly web applications using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). I collaborate with other developers and clients to deliver high-quality products that meet the user requirements and specifications. I also test and debug the web applications to ensure their functionality and performance.

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science from the Awadhesh Pratap Singh Vishwavidyalaya, where I have learned various programming languages, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles. I have also completed several certifications in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and soft skills development, which have enhanced my web development skills and knowledge. I am passionate about innovative design and emerging trends in the web development sector, and I seek a challenging position that will allow me to utilize my skills and knowledge for the growth of the organization and my professional development."
